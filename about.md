 I'm a C++ programmer focusing on performance and optimization. I'm interested in domains such as 3d graphics, HPC, low-level optimization. 
 I'm programming in in C++ since 2008. I have knowledge of C++ 11/14/17 standards, and some parts of C++ 20, algorithms and data structures. I like working with technologies such as Vulkan, SIMD, x64 processor architecture.
 I've used to participated in competitive programming contests such as Polish Olimpiad in Informatics, Polish ICPC (AMPPZ). Solved many algorithmic problems on sites like SPOJ, Hackerrank.
